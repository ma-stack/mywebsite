   <h1>The goal of the game is really simple.You try to be the last person "alive" and you win the whole game. In order to do so you start off going into a match (public) and you go through a series of mini games and try to win every single one in order to win/last person "alive."
   Here are some example of mini games that you might play in fally guys before you play 
   <li> Jump Showdown </li>
   <li> See Saw</li>
   <li> Dizzy Heights</li>
   <li> Fall Mountain</li>
   <li> Hex-A-Gone</li>
   <h2> How hard of a game is it?</h2>
   <p>As you play your first match of fall guys it could be a little hard considering the fact that you do not know how your avatar moves in the game.
 With that being said moving your avatar is the MOST DIFICULT thing to because in some mini games require you to cross the finish line (crossing the finish line gets you closer on winning or in the games term "Qualify") As well as in other mini games you need to avoid obstacles in order to survive.
   </p> 
   <h3> There are different types of colors to choose to customize your avatar with a combonation such as the following</h3>
<ul>
    
        <li>blue </li>
        <li>pirate skin 
            <ul>
                <li>jacket</li>
                <li>emote: hands up</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>
